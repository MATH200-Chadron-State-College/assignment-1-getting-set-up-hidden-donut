# Getting Set up With R, RStudio, and Git!

Hello all! Welcome to your first github repository! The rules of this first assignment are pretty easy. The goal is to be able to correctly setup and understand how your computer talks back and forth between github. Be sure to watch the first posted video to successfully setup your machine so git knows who you are! By the end of this assignment, you should be able to successfully commit and push your code to github, know the different types of contained in RStudio, and create an environment to contain your work for the duration of this class.

Assignment 1: Getting Set Up

1.  Clone this repository into your machine's RStudio, following the steps from the first video

2.  Make a change to the end of this README.md, stating what your goals are for this class. Commit and Push these changes

3.  Create a text file and call it "Intro". Write a few paragraphs introducing yourself. Commit and push this file.

4.  Go to GitHub and see that your changes have appeared. You should have (at least) 2 commits to your repository - one adding or modifying README.md, another adding Introduction.
