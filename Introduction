Hi! My name is David Johnson. I am a sophomore student at CSC majoring in chemistry and minoring in applied statistics. Upon Dr. Stack's advice, I decided to take this class (and potentially the whole data analytics minor) as a continuation of my study of statistics. I have really enjoyed learning the basics of statistical data analysis, the theory of statistics, and a bit about sampling. Now I am looking forward to learning new ways to apply statistics through technology. 
As far as hobbies and interests - I love music. I play guitar, drums, and piano and love to sing as well. I'm a big fan of Star Wars, and I really love The Lord of the Rings. 
My current academic plan is to go into some sort of research in chemistry. However, I will go wherever the Lord takes me, and I am really enjoying statistics. So who knows! Perhaps I will become a statistician or data analyst. 
Another important fact about me is that I am an evangelical Christian. I believe that I am justified in the finished work of Christ alone. This is very meaningful in my life and is a paradigm for the way I make most of my decisions.
I'm excited for this class, Jayden! Thanks for all your work to make this minor happen. I'm excited to explore it.
